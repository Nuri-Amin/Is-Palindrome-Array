# Is Palindrome Array (C++)

This is a simple C++ project that checks whether a given array is a palindrome.

In this version, I used a **hardcoded array**, where the values are manually assigned in the code (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 30, 20, 10).

The program compares elements from the beginning and end to determine if the array reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Key Concepts
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditional statements (if)
- Logical thinking

*(Future improvement: allow user input for the array values.)*
